Sales and Transaction Policy (MUST READ)

The seller operates this website independently and reserves the right to manage all transactions personally. **Viewing this catalogue does not constitute a guaranteed sale.** All sales are subject to final agreement between the buyer and the seller.

PROTECTION OF SELLER (YOU)

Geographic Scope: Sales are EU Preferred.
Final Veto Right: The seller reserves the explicit right to decline any inquiry or sale based on the buyer's location, address history, or shipping risks (e.g., countries that impose complex customs, tax liabilities on the seller, or have a history of unreliable delivery). **The seller determines the acceptable buyer/destination.**

Payment Protocol (Buyer is Responsible for Fees)

All transactions must be pre-paid in full before any item is shipped.

1.  Price Stated:** The price listed on the website is for the item *only* and does **NOT** include shipping costs or PayPal fees.
2.  Contact First:** The buyer must contact `hitrate@gmail.com` before payment to obtain the accurate **Shipping Cost + Insurance**.
3.  Total Transfer Calculation:** The buyer is responsible for transferring the FULL TOTAL AMOUNT** calculated as:
    $$\text{Total Transfer} = \text{Item Price} + \text{Shipping Cost} + \text{PayPal Fee}$$

PayPal Fee Enforcement

Goods & Services (G&S): If chosen, the buyer must calculate the precise PayPal fee for the entire transaction amount (Item + Shipping + Fee) and add it to their payment.
Requirement:** The seller must receive the exact listed price plus shipping. Any shortfall due to uncalculated or underpaid PayPal fees will result in the transaction being held or canceled.
